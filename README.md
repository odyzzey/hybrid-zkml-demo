# hybrid-layers

This is a quick sketch of a hypothetical concept called hybrid zkML.

The general is that if zkVMs are typically cycle constrained to make running ML inference inside them one could, in a compromise, run a subset of layers/parameters inside the zkVM while the others run traditionally and still get some level of assurance regarding the soundness of the output.

This definitely is not a full implementation of such a system but does demonstrate the structure.

## Quick Start

First, make sure [rustup] is installed. The
[`rust-toolchain.toml`][rust-toolchain] file will be used by `cargo` to
automatically install the correct version.

To build all methods and execute the method within the zkVM, run the following
command:

```bash
cargo run
```

This is an empty template, and so there is no expected output (until you modify
the code).

### Executing the project locally in development mode

During development, faster iteration upon code changes can be achieved by leveraging [dev-mode], we strongly suggest activating it during your early development phase. Furthermore, you might want to get insights into the execution statistics of your project, and this can be achieved by specifying the environment variable `RUST_LOG="[executor]=info"` before running your project.

Put together, the command to run your project in development mode while getting execution statistics is:

```bash
RUST_LOG="[executor]=info" RISC0_DEV_MODE=1 cargo run
```
